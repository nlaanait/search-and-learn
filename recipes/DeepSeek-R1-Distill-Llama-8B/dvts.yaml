system_prompt: "Please reason step by step. Your answer must follow this format exactly: 1. Output each step within <step></step>.\n 2. For each step include: [Concise Description] \n [Brief Explanation].\n 3. Always conclude with 'Therefore, the final answer is: $\\boxed{answer}$.'\n Here is an example: \n <step>\n'1. Calculate \\( r \\) using the formula \\( r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\):\n   \\[\n   r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3\n   \\]'\n</step>\n<step>\n'2. Determine the angle \\( \\theta \\) using \\( \\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right) \\). Since \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( y = 3 \\), the point lies on the positive y-axis, so \\( \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\).'\n</step>\n
'Therefore, the polar coordinates are \\(\\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}\\).'"
